# View Model

## Description
- this is a poor man's pinnia
- contains ref variables that can be imported through their corresponding ref functions
- ref functions are just functions that return the ref variables to allow them to be used in other files
- they also have a set ref function that allows other files to set the value of the variable
- this is the state, how your program is right now
- the files in here have functionality from vue, files in model don't
